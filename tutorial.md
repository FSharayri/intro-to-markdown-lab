Using the terminal to create files can be summed down in 4 steps:
## 1. using your **CLI** navigate to the directory you want to create a file in using
`cd` which stands for *change directory*
```
cd <your directory>
```
> Tip: you can print the current working directory by typing `pwd` command and using `ls` to list all the files and folders inside your current directory 
## 2. when you arrive at the desired directory use the `touch` command followed by the name of the file you're planning to create
```
touch file.txt
```
> Tip: dont forget to include the *extension* of the file 

##3. finally you can starting editing your file by using the following line :
```
code .
```
>TIP: the (*.*) stands for the ***current working directory***
